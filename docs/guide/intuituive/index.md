# Terminal apps (intuiTUIve)

`rs-rich-intuituive` (`intuituive`, new and early) is a framework for
terminal apps, full-screen or inline. You describe the screen once as a tree of nodes
and keep your state in **signals**. When a signal changes, the nodes that
read it draw again, and only the cells that changed are sent to the
terminal. You never write a draw loop, a layout pass, or "what changed"
bookkeeping.

It builds on `rs-rich-interact`, so its sessions, its headless test driver
and its components (inputs, selectors, forms, pagers) all work inside an
app. Any rich renderable (tables, Markdown, syntax, charts) is a node.

```toml
[dependencies]
rs-rich-intuituive = "0.0.2"
```

One dependency is enough: `intuituive::rich` is rs-rich and
`intuituive::interact` is rs-rich-interact. New here? The
[tutorial](tutorial.md) builds a to-do app step by step, and the template
starts a project with one command. Coming from ratatui?
[Porting a ratatui app](porting.md) maps every concept and walks through a
Yazi-style file manager rebuilt on intuiTUIve.

```bash
cargo generate --git https://github.com/buchochelliq-labs/rs-rich-cli templates/intuituive-app
```

## A first app

```rust
use intuituive::prelude::*;

fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    App::new(|| {
        let count = signal(0);
        column([
            text!("[b]Count:[/] {count}").panel("Counter"),
            label("[dim]+ adds one · q quits"),
        ])
        .on_key("+", move |_| count.update(|c| *c += 1))
        .on_key("q", |cx| cx.quit())
    })
    .run()
}
```

The closure passed to `App::new` runs once. It creates the state (`count`)
and returns the root node. The rest happens on its own:

- `text!` reads `count`, so pressing `+` redraws that one line;
- the label and the panel's border are not touched;
- the terminal receives the one changed digit.

`App::run` takes the screen and restores the terminal on every way out,
including Ctrl+C and a panic.

## Nodes

| Builder | What it shows |
|---|---|
| `text!("…{signal}…")` | Console markup with `format!` arguments; signals format as their value and are read reactively |
| `text(move \|\| …)` | Markup from any closure; every signal it reads is tracked |
| `label("…")` | Markup that never changes |
| `renderable(move \|\| table)` | Any rich renderable, rebuilt when the signals it read change |
| `column([...])`, `row([...])` | Children laid out down or across |
| `grid([sizes], [...])` | Children in rows and columns (see [Grids](#grids)) |
| `each(move \|\| keys, \|key\| node)` | One child per key, kept by key across reorders |
| `switch(move \|\| key, \|key\| node)` | One child at a time, chosen by key; the others are kept (tabs, wizard steps) |
| `list(move \|\| rows, selected)` | A scrolling list with a selected row (`selected` is a `Signal<usize>`); ↑↓ jk, Home/End and PageUp/PageDown move it |
| `log.view()` | A streaming [`Log`](#logs) |
| `component(Input::new("Name"), on_done)` | A `rich-interact` component (see [Components](#components)) |
| `repeating(\|\| Input::new("Add"), on_done)` | The same, built fresh after each answer (an entry box) |

`.panel("Title")` wraps a node in a rounded border that is highlighted
while the focus is inside it, and `.padding(1, 2)` leaves space round it
(rows above and below, columns either side).

## Layout

A child's size along its parent's axis:

- `.fixed(3)`: exactly 3 cells;
- `.percent(40)`: 40% of the parent;
- `.auto()`: as big as its content (the lines a text wraps to, a panel's
  content and border, a list's rows). When a signal the content reads
  changes, the parent lays out again, and the nodes after it move;
- `.flex(2)`: a weighted share of what is left. A node with no size is
  `flex(1)`.

Any of them can be clamped with `.min_size(n)` and `.max_size(n)`. A
flexible child that reaches a clamp keeps it, and the others share the rest,
as CSS flexbox does. When the children ask for more than there is, they
shrink from the last one, to their minimums first.

```rust
column([
    text!("{status}").auto(),                    // as tall as the status
    row([
        sidebar.percent(25).min_size(20),
        main.flex(1),
    ]),
    label("[muted]q quits").fixed(1),
])
.gap(1)
```

`.gap(1)` leaves a row (or, in a `row`, a column) between neighbours.

### Grids

```rust
grid(
    [Size::Fixed(12), Size::Flex(1), Size::Flex(1)],
    [
        label("logo").span(1, 2),     // one column, two rows
        label("title").span(2, 1),    // two columns
        cpu.panel("CPU"),
        memory.panel("Memory"),
    ],
)
.rows([Size::Auto])
.gap(1)
```

- Children fill the grid row by row; each takes the first place it fits.
- Columns are the sizes given. Rows share the height evenly unless
  `.rows([...])` sizes them, and rows past the last size given take that
  size, so `.rows([Size::Auto])` makes every row as tall as its content.

## State

```rust
let selected = signal(0usize);
let is_first = memo(move || selected.get() == 0);
```

- `get()` reads a value, and `set(v)` or `update(|v| …)` writes it. A node
  that reads a signal while drawing subscribes to it, and a write redraws
  exactly those nodes. `set` with an equal value does nothing.
- `watch(move || source, move |value, cx| …)` runs a callback when a value
  changes (and once at the start), between frames, with a `Ctx`: load a
  preview when the selection moves, save when a document changes. A watch
  made while a screen is built stops when the screen closes.
- A `memo` derives a value and notifies its readers only when the result
  changes. In a list where each row reads `memo(move || selected.get() == i)`,
  a move redraws two rows, not all of them.
- Signals are `Copy`: move them into as many closures as you need.

## Input and focus

```rust
column([
    label("one").focusable().on_key("x", |_| { /* … */ }).panel("One"),
    label("two").focusable().panel("Two"),
])
.on_key("q", |cx| cx.quit())
```

- **Keys** go to the focused node first, then bubble up through its
  ancestors until a binding uses them.
- **Tab** and **Shift+Tab** move the focus through focusable nodes. A
  handler can move it too, with `cx.focus_next()` or `cx.focus(id)`.
- **Clicks:** `.on_click(|cx| …)` gets the clicks inside the node and
  focuses it. The app remembers where each node was drawn, so you never
  store rectangles yourself.
- **Key names** are the ones `rs-rich-interact` uses: `"q"`, `"ctrl+s"`,
  `"up k"` (either key).
- **Out of the Tab order:** `.no_focus()` keeps a list or component you only
  show from taking the focus.
- **Showing the focus:** panels highlight their border while the focus is
  inside them. A leaf can show it too: `.focus_style("reverse")` (any style
  or theme name) restyles it, filled to its full width, while it has the
  focus, which is how a list shows its selected row.

## Components

```rust
use rich_interact::Input;

let name = signal(String::new());
column([
    component(Input::new("Name"), move |value, _| name.set(value)).fixed(1),
    text!("Hello, {name}"),
])
```

- A focused component takes keys first. Keys it does not use bubble on, and
  the terminal caret follows its cursor.
- Its answer (Enter in an `Input`, a pick in a `Select`) goes to the
  closure.
- `.on_cancel(|cx| …)` handles Esc. Without it, Esc bubbles to your own
  bindings.
- A component answers once and then shows its answer. For an entry box
  that takes one entry after another, use `repeating(make, on_done)`: it
  builds a fresh component after each answer.

## Logs

```rust
let log = Log::new(1_000);           // keeps the last 1,000 lines
log.push("[green]started[/]");
log.view().panel("Log")
```

A log renders each line once. On an append it moves the rows already on
screen up and renders only the new lines. That is why a log tail costs less
than redrawing every row, which is ratatui's approach.

## Tables, tabs and scrolling

```rust
use intuituive::widgets::{table, tabs, Column};

let selected = signal(0usize);
let tab = signal(0usize);
column([
    tabs(|| vec!["Files".into(), "Log".into()], tab).fixed(1),
    switch(move || tab.get(), move |tab| match tab {
        0 => table(
            vec![Column::new("Name", Size::Flex(1)), Column::new("Size", Size::Auto)],
            move || files.with(|f| f.iter().map(|f| vec![f.name.clone(), f.size()]).collect()),
            selected,
        ),
        _ => scroll(text(move || log.get())),
    }),
])
```

- **`table(columns, rows, selected)`**:
  - The header row stays in view, and each column is sized like a child
    in a row (cells, a percentage, a share, or `Size::Auto` to fit what
    is in view).
  - One row is selected. ↑/↓ (or k/j), PgUp/PgDn and Home/End move it, a
    click selects a row, and the wheel moves it.
  - `virtual_table(columns, len, row, selected)` asks only for the rows in
    view, so a million rows cost a screenful.
- **`tabs(titles, selected)`** is a strip of titles. ←/→ and 1–9 move the
  selection, and so does a click. Pair it with `switch` on the same
  signal for the content.
- **`scroll(child)`** is a viewport onto a child laid out at its full
  height (up to 4000 rows).
  - The arrow keys, PgUp/PgDn, Home/End and the wheel scroll it, and a
    scrollbar appears when the child does not fit.
  - The focus moving to a node inside scrolls that node into view.
  - The child draws into an offscreen screen with its own damage, so only
    what changed inside draws, and the rows in view are copied out.
  - `scroll_with(child, offset)` puts the first row in view in a signal
    you can read and set.

### Trees, split panes, calendars and lists

```rust
use intuituive::widgets::{calendar, hsplit, tree, virtual_list, Date, TreeItem};

let path = signal(Vec::<usize>::new());
let ratio = signal(0.3);
let day = signal(Date::new(2026, 10, 7));
hsplit(
    tree(|| vec![TreeItem::new("src").children([TreeItem::new("main.rs")])], path),
    column([
        calendar(day).fixed(8),
        virtual_list(|| 100_000, |i| format!("line {i}"), signal(0usize)),
    ]),
    ratio,
)
```

- **`tree(items, selected)`** shows nested `TreeItem`s with the selection
  as a path of indices. ↑/↓ move, → expands, ← collapses or goes to the
  parent, Enter or Space toggles, and a click on an arrow toggles it. `tree_with` puts the
  expanded paths in a signal of your own. Keys a leaf does not use (Enter
  on it, ← at the top) bubble up to your bindings.
- **`hsplit(first, second, ratio)`** puts two panes side by side, and
  `vsplit` stacks them. Dragging the divider moves it, and so do Alt+←/→
  (Alt+↑/↓ when stacked) from inside either pane. `split_with` sets the
  smallest size of a pane (three cells by default).
- **`calendar(selected)`** is a month grid of a `Date` signal: the arrows
  move by day and week, PgUp/PgDn by month, a click picks a day and the
  wheel changes month. `Date` has the date arithmetic it needs (weekday,
  adding days and months, month lengths).
- **`virtual_list(len, row, selected)`** is the list form of
  `virtual_table`: it asks only for the rows in view.

## The mouse

Every mouse event (press, release, drag, movement, the wheel) goes to the
deepest node under the pointer, in that node's own coordinates, and
bubbles up through its ancestors until one uses it.

- **A press** first focuses the deepest focusable node under the pointer.
- **`.on_click(handler)`** handles a left click.
- **`.on_mouse(|cx, mouse| …)`** handles every mouse event. It returns
  whether it used the event.
- **A drag** can be kept by the widget it started in, even when the
  pointer leaves it: call `capture_mouse()` from its handler.
- **Hover** is state. A widget that asks whether it is hovered draws again
  when the pointer enters or leaves it. The terminal's movement reports
  are turned on only once something asks.

### Selecting and copying text

Turning on the mouse usually costs the terminal's own text selection. In
an intuiTUIve app, a drag that starts where nothing uses the press selects
the text under it, shown reversed, and copies it when the button is let
go, with OSC 52, so it works over SSH too, in terminals that allow it. A
toast says how much was copied. `App::selectable(false)` turns this off.

## Your own widgets

Anything the built-in nodes do, a widget of yours can do too. It
implements `Widget`, and `widget(w)` makes a node of it, which takes every
builder (`.flex`, `.panel`, `.on_key`, `.name`):

```rust
use intuituive::widget::{widget, Canvas, DrawCx, EventCx, MouseExt, Used, Widget, WidgetEvent};

/// A counter that a click or `+` counts up.
struct Counter(u32);

impl Widget for Counter {
    fn name(&self) -> &'static str {
        "counter"
    }

    fn draw(&mut self, cx: &mut DrawCx, canvas: &mut Canvas) {
        let style = cx.style("accent", "bold");
        canvas.print(0, 0, &format!("count {}", self.0), Some(&style));
    }

    fn event(&mut self, cx: &mut EventCx, event: &WidgetEvent) -> Used {
        match event {
            WidgetEvent::Key(key) if *key == Key::char('+') => {}
            WidgetEvent::Mouse(mouse) if mouse.is_press() => {}
            _ => return Used::No,
        }
        self.0 += 1;
        cx.redraw();
        Used::Yes
    }

    fn focusable(&self) -> bool {
        true
    }
}
```

What a widget can do:

- **`draw`** writes cells on a `Canvas`. The canvas is the widget's
  rectangle, cleared, in its own coordinates, and `print`, `set`, `fill`
  and `lines` (rendered rich segments) write to it. Signals read here make
  it draw again.
- **`event`** gets keys while the focus is on it (or inside it) and mouse
  events over it. What it does not use bubbles on. `cx.redraw()` draws it
  again after a change to its own state, and `cx.app()` can quit, open a
  screen or move the focus.
- **`measure`** says how big it wants to be, for `Size::Auto` and for
  modals sized to their content.
- **`children` and `layout`** make it a container. Its children are
  ordinary nodes, drawn after it, so it can draw chrome round them (a
  header, a scrollbar).
- **`caret`** places the text caret while it has the focus.

`table` and `tabs` are built on this trait, as an app's own widget would
be. `leaf` is still the shortest way to a node that only draws, and
`component` hosts rs-rich-interact components, which also run outside an
app.

## Screens and modals

![A modal asking whether to quit, over the screens example](../../media/tapes/intuituive/modal.png)

An app is a stack of screens. A handler opens one with `cx.push`, and
`cx.pop` goes back:

```rust
fn detail(id: u32) -> Node {
    let count = signal(0);
    text!("item {id}: {count}")
        .on_key("+", move |_| count.update(|c| *c += 1))
        .on_key("esc", |cx| cx.pop())
}

label("home").on_key("enter", |cx| cx.push(|| detail(7)))
```

- The screen below is kept, with its state and its focus, and comes back as
  it was.
- A screen's closure can create signals and call `every`; its timers stop
  when it closes.
- `cx.replace(build)` swaps the top screen, as a wizard's steps do.

A modal is a screen in a box over the one below, which keeps drawing:

```rust
.on_key("q", |cx| {
    cx.modal(Size::Auto, Size::Auto, || {
        label("Quit? [b]y[/] / [b]n[/]")
            .padding(0, 1)
            .panel("Quit")
            .on_key("y", |cx| cx.quit())
            .on_key("n esc", |cx| cx.pop())
    })
})
```

Its width and height are cells (`Size::Fixed`), a share of the screen
(`Size::Percent`), the content's size (`Size::Auto`), or the whole screen
(`Size::Flex`). Keys and clicks reach only the top screen.

### Pop-ups

`cx.popup(anchor, placement, width, height, build)` opens a box like a
modal, but next to a node rather than in the middle of the screen: below,
above, right or left of `anchor` (a node's `id()`), flipped to the other
side when there is no room. Esc that nothing used, or a press outside it,
closes it. Dropdowns, menus and autocomplete lists start here.

```rust
let field = label("Colour: red").focusable();
let at = field.id();
field.on_key("enter", move |cx| {
    cx.popup(at, Placement::Below, Size::Fixed(12), Size::Auto, || {
        label("red\ngreen\nblue").panel("Pick").on_key("q", |cx| cx.pop())
    })
})
```

The anchor can also be a `Rect` of the screen, for a pop-up at a place
rather than a node: `EventCx::rect()` gives a widget its own, and
`Ctx::pointer()` gives where the mouse event being handled happened.

### Menus

```rust
use intuituive::menu::{context_menu, menu_bar, Menu, MenuItem};

column([
    menu_bar(vec![
        Menu::new("File", vec![
            MenuItem::new("Save", |cx| save(cx)).hint("ctrl+s"),
            MenuItem::separator(),
            MenuItem::new("Quit", |cx| cx.quit()),
        ]),
    ])
    .fixed(1),
    body.on_mouse(|cx, mouse| {
        if mouse.kind != MouseKind::Down(Button::Right) {
            return false;
        }
        context_menu(cx, vec![MenuItem::new("Copy", copy), MenuItem::new("Paste", paste)]);
        true
    }),
])
```

- **`menu_bar(menus)`**: ←/→ move between titles while it has the focus,
  and Enter, ↓ or a click opens a menu below its title.
- **A menu**: ↑/↓ move past separators, Enter or a click runs an item
  (the menu closes first, so the item may open a screen), the pointer
  moves the selection, and Esc or a press outside closes it.
- **`context_menu(cx, items)`** opens at the pointer from a mouse handler,
  and **`open_menu(cx, at, placement, items)`** next to a node or a `Rect`.

### The command palette and help

Every binding made with `.bind(keys, description, handler)` is a command.
`cx.command_palette()` lists the ones on the focused node and its
ancestors, searched as you type, and runs the one picked as its key would.
`cx.help()` lists the same bindings with their keys. Keys open either:

```rust
App::new(build).palette_key("ctrl+p").help_key("?")
```

Bindings made with `.on_key` have no description and stay out of both.
Name a node (`.name("Editor")`) to group its commands under that name.

## Toasts and animations

- **`cx.toast(markup)`** shows a message at the bottom right for three
  seconds, and `toast_for(markup, duration)` for as long as you say.
  Toasts stack and do not take the focus.
- **`cx.animate(signal, to, duration, easing)`** moves a `Signal<f64>` to
  `to` over `duration`, setting it every frame, so whatever reads it moves
  with it: a split's ratio, a gauge, a scroll offset. `Easing` is `Linear`,
  `EaseIn`, `EaseOut` or `EaseInOut`. A new animation of the same signal
  takes over from where it is. While one runs, the app draws at about 60
  frames a second, and it goes back to waiting for input when they end.

```rust
let ratio = signal(0.5);
hsplit(left, right, ratio).on_key("z", move |cx| {
    cx.animate(ratio, 0.8, Duration::from_millis(200), Easing::EaseOut)
})
```

## Timers and background work

```rust
App::new(|| {
    let seconds = signal(0);
    every(Duration::from_secs(1), move |_| seconds.update(|s| *s += 1));
    text!("up {seconds}s")
})
```

- **Timers:** `every` runs a handler on a schedule. Call it inside
  `App::new`'s closure (or a screen's), next to the signals it writes.
- **Tasks:** `spawn(work, done)` runs `work` on its own thread and `done`
  with the result back on the app's thread, where it can write signals,
  open a screen or quit. `spawn_future` does the same for a future that does
  not need a particular async runtime. Both return a `Task`, which you can
  `cancel()` (its result is dropped).

```rust
.on_key("r", move |_| {
    spawn(fetch_report, move |report, cx| {
        cx.push(move || report_screen(report));
    });
})
```

- **Resources:** `resource(fetch)` loads a value in the background and
  holds `Load::Loading`, `Load::Ready(value)` or `Load::Failed(error)`. A
  node that reads it redraws when it arrives; `reload()` fetches again and
  drops any older result still on its way.

```rust
let user = resource(|| api::user(42));
text(move || match user.get() {
    Load::Loading => "[muted]loading…".into(),
    Load::Ready(user) => format!("Hello, {}", user.name),
    Load::Failed(error) => format!("[bad]{error}"),
})
.on_key("r", move |_| user.reload())
```

- **Other threads:** signals live on the app's thread. Work you start
  yourself (a tokio runtime, a file watcher) sends closures through a
  `Proxy` from `cx.proxy()` or `app.proxy()`: `proxy.run(move ||
  status.set(body))`, or `proxy.run_with(|cx| …)` for a `Ctx` too.

## Themes

A `Theme` styles what the framework draws (borders, the focused border,
panel titles) and names styles for markup. The presets, `Theme::dark()` (the
default), `Theme::light()` and `Theme::mono()`, each define `accent`,
`muted`, `good`, `warn` and `bad`:

```rust
label("[accent]ops[/] · [good]12 up[/] · [bad]1 down[/]")
```

Add your own with `Theme::dark().style("brand", Style::parse("bold magenta")?)`,
set it with `App::theme`, and switch at run time with `cx.set_theme(theme)`;
everything is drawn again in the new theme.

### Theme files, reloaded live

```rust
app.theme_file("theme.ini").run()
```

```ini
[styles]
accent = bold magenta
border.focused = bright_green
```

The file is rich's theme format: a `[styles]` section of `name = style`
lines. `border`, `border.focused` and `title` restyle the framework's parts,
and every name works in markup. The app reads the file again whenever it
changes, so you can tune colours while it runs. A file that does not parse
leaves the last good styles in place, and the [inspector](#inspector) shows
the error. `Theme::load(path)` and `theme.with_config(text)` read the same
format without watching.

## Inline apps

![An inline app finishing under the prompt, with the scrollback above it kept](../../media/tapes/intuituive/inline.png)

```rust
App::new(|| progress_view()).inline(3).run()
```

`App::inline(rows)` runs in a few rows under the prompt instead of the
alternate screen, like a command's progress output. Only those rows are
drawn, with cursor moves relative to them, so the scrollback above is left
alone. When the app ends, its last frame stays, and the prompt continues
below it. The mouse is left to the terminal.

## Testing

`render_with` runs an app headless, pressing keys, and returns the last
screen:

```rust
let screen = app.render_with(&["+", "+", "q"], 30, 2)?;
assert_eq!(screen[0].trim_end(), "Count: 2");
```

For more control, such as clicks, resizes, waits on a virtual clock, or the
exact bytes sent, use `App::run_on` with `rs-rich-interact`'s `Headless`
backend. `App::wait_for_tasks(true)` waits for background tasks before each
scripted event, so a test sees a task's result however fast the machine is.

## Inspector

![The to-do app with the inspector docked on the right](../../media/tapes/intuituive/inspector.png)

```bash
INTUITUIVE_INSPECT=1 cargo run      # any app, no code change
```

or `App::inspector(true)` in code. The inspector docks on the right, and
the app is laid out in the space to its left. F12 shows and hides it. It
shows:

- the node tree as it is, each node's builder (or its `.name("…")`), what
  it holds (a panel's title, a list's length, a grid's shape) and its size,
  or `hidden`;
- in yellow, the nodes that drew in the last frame; reversed, the focused
  node;
- the frame's cost: nodes drawn of those made dirty, damaged rectangles and
  cells, and the bytes sent;
- the theme file's state, and its error if the last edit did not parse.

It is the quickest way to see that a change redraws what it should and
nothing more.

## Against ratatui

`tests/versus_ratatui.rs` draws the same ops dashboard with ratatui 0.30 and
with intuiTUIve, and asserts that intuiTUIve is no slower and sends no more
bytes.

| 80x24, release | ratatui | intuiTUIve |

[The design note](../../design/intuituive.md) explains why. It also lists
the architectural problems in ratatui that intuiTUIve is built to avoid:
redraw-everything frames, state kept apart from widgets, hand-written event
routing and hit-testing, and per-widget styling.

Coming from ratatui? [Using rich with ratatui](../ratatui.md) covers
`rs-rich-ratatui`, the interop crate: rich renderables drawn as ratatui
widgets in an existing app, and ratatui widgets run inside rs-rich-interact.

## Status

This is an early slice (0.0.x), so the API will change. Still to come:
Python bindings for the framework, as rs-rich-interact's components already
have, the built-in nodes moved onto the `Widget` trait, and accessibility
and serving an app to a browser, which are designed but not built (see
[the widgets design note](../../design/intuituive-widgets.md)).
