# Changelog

Notable changes to the port. Because the mirror crates track upstream versions,
entries here note which upstream release was absorbed and what our own crates did.

The format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Workspace scaffold**: `rich` (core, mirroring upstream **15.0.0**),
  `rich-ext` (`0.1.0`), and `rich-cli` (mirroring upstream **1.8.1**).
- **First vertical slice** of the `rich` core, parity-tested against real
  `rich` 15.0.0: `color`, `style`, `cells`, `segment`, `markup`, `text`, `theme`,
  `console`, plus the `protocol` extension points (`Renderable`, `Highlighter`).
- **Internal plugin registry** in `rich-ext` (`ExtensionRegistry`, `ConsoleExt`)
  with an example `NumberHighlighter`, demonstrating the core/ext boundary.
- **`rich-cli` binary**: argument handling, plain-file printing, and a capability
  demo. Rich rendering subcommands are tracked as roadmap issues.
- **Governance**: `AGENTS.md`, `docs/{ARCHITECTURE,PORTING,PLUGINS,DIVERGENCES}.md`,
  the `sync-upstream` and `port-module` skills, `UPSTREAM.toml` pins, and the
  golden parity harness (`scripts/capture_golden.py`).
